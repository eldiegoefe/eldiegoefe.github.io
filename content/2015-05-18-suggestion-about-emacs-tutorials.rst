I read many Emacs blogs since I started the trip of learning it. There
are great beginner's tutorials and also webpages for more advanced
users. However, there's a habit I find repeatedly on the majority of
sites which goes against one of the Almighty Editor advantages:
instructions usually refer to default keybindings, like it was
invariant that you visit files only with C-x C-f, or like the only
admited shortcuts to the beginning and ending of the current line
where C-a and C-e, or if the incremental search inevitable required to
type C-s. In my case, keybindings for all these functions and many
others are personalized, and the default ones are disabled (I visit
files with C-o, move the point to the beginning or end of the line
with M-h and S-M-h, and activate incremental searches with C-f).

My advice to all the Emacs educator's community is to refer and cite
the suggested function names in tutorials and comments, instead of
using their default keybindings. For example, you should talk about
isearch-forward instead of writing C-s; it is better to write the
whole move-beginning-of-line function name instead of only refering to
C-a. This way, it is possible to follow step by step instructions
using execute-extended-command (generally executed with M-x, although
in my setup that happens with M-a).

Then, if you need to know the keybinding to a function, just execute
describe-function to get its abstract and see its keybindings.
