yoga is a holistic approach to well-being of mind and body (en la descripción de
un libro de AG Mohan). [enlace](https://www.svastha.net/books/)

Yoga is "citta vritti nirodhah".

This translates as: 'the restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is
yoga'. Not perhaps what you might have been expecting. What this means is that
yoga is a practice which disarms the (often powerful) fluctuations of the mind.
It is a common principle in Eastern philosophy that mental fluctuations, driven
by attachment to things, ideas, people, are the cause of suffering, and that
enlightenment is a release from suffering. from
